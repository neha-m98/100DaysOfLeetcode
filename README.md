This repository contains my solutions for the #100DaysOfLeetCode challenge. The challenge aims to solve LeetCode coding problems consistently for 100 days, improving problem-solving skills, and preparing for coding interviews.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind starting the #100DaysOfLeetCode challenge is to enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain proficiency in data structures and algorithms. By committing to solving LeetCode problems daily, I aim to develop a solid foundation in coding, learn new algorithms and techniques, and improve my problem-solving speed.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the day of the challenge. Each folder contains the solution files for the problems solved on that particular day. Additionally, the repository includes a dedicated `resources` folder that contains any additional resources or notes related to the challenge.

## Solutions

The solutions are implemented using various programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++. Each solution is accompanied by a brief explanation of the approach used and any necessary observations. The code is well-commented and follows best practices to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Track My Progress

To track my progress throughout the challenge, I maintain a daily log in the [Progress.md](Progress.md) file. This log includes the problem description, its difficulty level, the implemented solution, and any additional notes or insights gained during the process. By maintaining this log, I aim to reflect on my progress and keep myself accountable.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal coding challenge, contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome. If you spot any issues, have better solutions, or want to suggest new problems to solve, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
